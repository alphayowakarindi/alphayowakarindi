### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Alphayo Wakarindi

I'm a full-stack web developer that mostly breaths, lives code and constantly learning. I enjoy working with vanilla CSS, Javascript, Vue, React, Ruby, Rails, Php, Laravel and Livewire. Currently, a student at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/), an online school for international software developers.
